To use lighting control software like [QLC+](https://www.qlcplus.org/), [DMXControl](https://www.dmxcontrol.org/) or [e:cue](https://www.osram.de/ecue/), you need fixture definition files that describe your lighting hardware. Since one software can usually only understand its own fixture definition format, switching between different programs can be difficult.

The *Open Fixture Library* ([open-fixture-library.org](https://open-fixture-library.org/)) tries to solve this problem by collecting fixture definitions and making them downloadable in various formats. Internally, it uses a [JSON format](docs/fixture-format.md) that tries to bundle as much information as possible for all the different output formats.
